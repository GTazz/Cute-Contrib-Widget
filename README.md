# Cute-Contrib-Widget

Cute-Contrib-Widget is a fun and artistic widget designed for GitHub profile README files. It mimics a contribution graph, allowing you to create pixel art or write messages in the form of a fake contribution screen.

## Development Status

This project is currently in the svg study phase. I´ve never even touched SVG before, so I´m learning as I go. The goal is to create a widget that can be easily integrated into GitHub profile READMEs.

I'll probably use node.js for the backend and a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend for creating the widget. The SVG will be generated on the server side and then served to the client.
